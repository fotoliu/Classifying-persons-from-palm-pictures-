The project was programmed in Matlab, it's goal was to successfully classify persons using a photo of their palm
against a dark background. i eliminated the background using clustering algorithms (K-means). I used an adaptive
threshold to binarize the images and a predefined function to extract the edges. The classification was based on sum
of absolute differences between the Fourier descriptors.
